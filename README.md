# Scraper for brandstofdata.nl

This project was created to avoid having to manually download and parse data 
from the website brandstofdata.nl. It still a work in progress as I want to 
add more functionalities.

Note that this script is written on and tested for macOS. It will probably 
not work on a Windows or Linux-machine.

## Why scrape this website?

My mother-in-law watches the kids every week and has 
to travel by car for approximately 150km. My girlfriend and I wanted to 
compensate her for the petrol cost. To do this fair and square for everyone 
I figured we needed the average cost of petrol each month.

### Easy/easier parsing

Instead of manually downloading the csv file every month or so, I wanted to 
automate this and make life a bit easier. And of course, as a beginner 
programmer, this is a nice little project to get better at python. The 
script makes use of Selenium for the scraping part

## How to run the script

Easy! Make sure you have Firefox installed and edit the download folder 
(currently: "~/Downloads/mainChart.csv") if necessary. Run the script via your 
preferred IDE or through the terminal.
